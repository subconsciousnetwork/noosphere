- An autopoietic feedback loop between your past and future self: https://twitter.com/startuployalist/status/1212822312531058689
- A knowledge garden: https://twitter.com/yoshikischmitz/status/1217059690133086209?s=20

- A seed crystal for a new multiplayer computing platform
- An open-ended and evolvable distributed system

I hope it works.
