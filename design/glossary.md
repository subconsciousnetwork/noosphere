| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| IPFS | InterPlanetary File System. hash-addressed storage in a peer-to-peer network. Content addressing is the big little idea behind IPFS. With content addressing (CIDs), you ask for a file using a hash of its contents. It doesn't matter where the file lives. Anyone in the network can serve that content.  |
| IPLD | InterPlanetary Linked Data. IPLD is a single namespace for all hash-inspired protocols. Through IPLD, links can be traversed across protocols, allowing you to explore data regardless of the underlying protocol. |
| Sphere | A Sphere is essentially a data structure for trivially associating names with content in a manner that is coherent and scales nicely with IPLD. It is the root of a user's personal data in the Noosphere. |
| petname | A petname system works like the address book on your phone. Instead of a global name system, you keep a personal address book that maps meaningful names to secure-decentralized addresses. Enables users to write human-readable names instead of DIDs when addressing other spheres. |
| geist | German for ghost. robots that crawl the web of thoughts, mixing and combining them into new ones, surfacing relevant ideas.|
| Subtext | A block-based, plain text format that is like a simpler form of markdown; it is the native format of Subconscious. https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/subtext |
| Supertext | working name for a file format that contains a list of links to other content - which, when rendered, consists entirely of transclusions. |
| transclusion | content that's embedded into a note by a link |
| Subconscious | a social notetaking app built on Noosphere. not public yet. |
| Noosphere | "thought sphere". a protocol for thought. a massively-multiplayer knowledge graph. You can think of it like a world-wide Wiki. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oUunOtzj27JmCFAD5Qpt1EGKseUcTzk2xq3Aok0kDxk/edit?usp=sharing https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere |
| memo | An envelope data structure that groups headers, content and a chronological history of revisions |
| block | a line in a Subtext note - text, link, quote, list, header, etc |
