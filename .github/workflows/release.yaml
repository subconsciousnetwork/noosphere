  # NOTE: This step is stateful. When there are unreleased changes on main, it
  # generates a candidate PR for the next release based on all the unreleased
  # changes and their implications for the versions of our packages. If such a
  # PR already exists, it will detect it and update in place. These PRs are
  # intended to stick around and update until a release is ready to be made.
  # Once merged, this step will detect the merge and generate Git tags and
  # corresponding Github releases for each package being released. Only at that
  # time will the rest of the steps in this workflow run.
