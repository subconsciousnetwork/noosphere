# Noosphere Ucan

This is a Rust library to help the next generation of web applications make use
of UCANs in their authorization flows. To learn more about UCANs and how you
might use them in your application, visit [https://ucan.xyz][ucan website] or
read the [spec][spec].

This project was forked from the official [rs-ucan] implementation, pending the finalization and broad adoption of the v1.0.0 spec (which represents a major breaking change from v0.10.0).
